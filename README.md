# Transfer A Directory from the Cluster to Local Machine

A script for transfering a directory from the cluster to the local machine.

## Instructions

* The user name and name of the directory with respect to the current folder should be entered into the script. 
* The directory address where the folder is downloaded will match that of the directory located on the cluster.
  ie. if transferFromTheCluster.sh is located in the directory /home/username/foo on the local machine,  
  by default the directory /home/usr/foo/data will be downloaded from the Palmetto Cluster into the current directory.
